# gCastle

[中文版本](./README.cn.md)

Version 1.0.3rc2 released.

The real datasets (id:10, 21, 22) used in [PCIC Causal Discovery Competition 2021 ](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/information/1000041487/introduction) have been released on the github: [temporary link](https://github.com/gcastle-hub/dataset).

## Introduction

gCastle is a causal structure learning toolchain developed by [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home). The package contains various functionality related to causal learning and evaluation, including: 
* Data generation and processing: data simulation, data reading operators, and data pre-processing operators（such as prior injection and variable selection).
* Causal structure learning: causal structure learning methods, including both classic and recently developed methods, especially gradient-based ones that can handle large problems.
* Evaluation metrics: various commonly used metrics for causal structure learning, including F1, SHD, FDR, TPR, FDR, NNZ, etc.

## Installation

### Dependencies
gCastle requires:
- python (>= 3.6, <=3.9)
- tqdm (>= 4.48.2)
- numpy (>= 1.19.1)
- pandas (>= 0.22.0)
- scipy (>= 1.7.3)
- scikit-learn (>= 0.21.1)
- matplotlib (>=2.1.2)
- networkx (>= 2.5)
- torch (>= 1.9.0)


 Note that the tensorflow dependency will be removed in the next version (v1.0.3, 2021.12.15), we are making efforts to rewrite some algorithms, such as MCSL, GOLEM, fully based on pytorch.


### PIP installation
```bash
pip install gcastle==1.0.3rc2
```

## Usage Example (PC algorithm)
```python
from castle.common import GraphDAG
from castle.metrics import MetricsDAG
from castle.datasets import IIDSimulation, DAG
from castle.algorithms import PC

# data simulation, simulate true causal dag and train_data.
weighted_random_dag = DAG.erdos_renyi(n_nodes=10, n_edges=10, 
                                      weight_range=(0.5, 2.0), seed=1)
dataset = IIDSimulation(W=weighted_random_dag, n=2000, method='linear', 
                        sem_type='gauss')
true_causal_matrix, X = dataset.B, dataset.X

# structure learning
pc = PC()
pc.learn(X)

# plot predict_dag and true_dag
GraphDAG(pc.causal_matrix, true_causal_matrix, 'result')

# calculate metrics
mt = MetricsDAG(pc.causal_matrix, true_causal_matrix)
print(mt.metrics)
```
